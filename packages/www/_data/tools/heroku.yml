title: Heroku
desc: Heroku is a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the
  deployment, management and scaling of modern web applications. Developers push
  code to Heroku via Git or GitHub, and Heroku’s buildpacks automatically detect
  the language (such as Ruby, Node.js, Python, Java, Go or PHP), install
  dependencies and compile a runnable slug. Applications run in lightweight,
  isolated containers called dynos, which can be scaled horizontally or
  vertically on demand. The platform also offers a marketplace of add-ons
  (databases, caching, monitoring, logging, etc.), a web-based dashboard and a
  command-line interface, allowing teams to iterate quickly without managing
  underlying infrastructure.
