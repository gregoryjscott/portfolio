title: Puppeteer
desc: Puppeteer is a Node library developed by Google that provides a high-level
  API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can
  be used to automate tasks that would normally be performed manually in the
  browser, such as form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, or capturing a
  timeline trace to diagnose performance issues. Puppeteer can also be used to
  generate screenshots and PDFs of web pages.
