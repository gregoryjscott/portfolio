    - title: Typescript
      desc: Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain
        JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, allowing
        developers to use type annotations to catch errors early in the
        development process. It also provides features such as classes, modules,
        and interfaces that are not available in JavaScript. Typescript is
        designed to make it easier to write and maintain large-scale
        applications.

    - title: Ruby
      desc: Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by
        Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy to use,
        yet powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web development,
        scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of
        blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby
        is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the
        dynamic creation of code at runtime.

    - title: HTML
      desc: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create
        webpages and web applications. It is the standard markup language used
        to create webpages and web applications. HTML is written in the form of
        HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. These tags
        describe the content and structure of webpages and web applications.
        HTML also provides a means to create interactive webpages and web
        applications with the use of HTML forms, which can be used to collect
        user input.

    - title: CSS
      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.

    - title: HAL
      subtitle: Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a a media type for
        representing resources with hyperlinks
      desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
        type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML,
        designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In
        HAL, each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its
        hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to
        navigate between related resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by
        an “_embedded” section. By providing a consistent convention for linking
        and embedding, HAL enables clients to follow HATEOAS
        principles—dynamically discovering available operations and
        transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.

    - title: Jekyll
      desc: Jekyll is an open-source, Ruby-based static site generator that transforms
        plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and
        Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using
        simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define metadata
        (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles content with shared
        layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it
        produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it
        delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub
        Pages) and maintain via version control.

        kernel. It is a free and powerful operating system that is used in many
        different types of computing devices, from smartphones to
        supercomputers. It is highly customizable and can be used for a variety
        of tasks, from web hosting to software development. It is also highly

    - title: macOS
      desc: macOS is Apple’s Unix‐based desktop operating system, first released in
        2001 as Mac OS X and built on the open‐source Darwin core and the
        proprietary XNU kernel. Designed exclusively for Mac computers, it
        combines a polished Aqua graphical interface with deep integration of
        hardware and software, offering features like Spotlight search, Time
        Machine backups, and Continuity for seamless work across Apple devices.
        With strong emphasis on stability, security and performance, macOS
        supports a rich ecosystem of native and third-party applications via the
        Mac App Store and developer tools such as Xcode, making it a popular
        choice for both creative professionals and everyday users.
