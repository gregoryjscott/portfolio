title: SQLite
desc: SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration,
  transactional SQL database engine. It is the most widely deployed database in
  the world with over 1 trillion installations. It is used in countless
  applications, from web browsers to operating systems. It is fast, reliable,
  and requires minimal setup and maintenance. It supports most of the SQL
  standard, including transactions, triggers, and views. It is also highly
  extensible, allowing developers to create custom functions and extensions.
