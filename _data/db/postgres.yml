title: Postgres
desc: Postgres is an open source object-relational database management system
  (ORDBMS) developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group. It is designed
  to be extensible, highly reliable, and standards-compliant. Postgres is used
  for a wide range of applications, including data warehousing, e-commerce, web
  applications, and more. It supports a wide range of data types, including
  JSON, XML, and user-defined types. It also provides powerful features such as
  triggers, stored procedures, and views. Postgres is highly scalable and can
  handle large amounts of data. It is also highly secure, with built-in
  authentication and access control.
