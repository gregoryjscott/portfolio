title: Firebase
desc: Firebase’s Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL JSON data store that
  lets you build rich, collaborative applications by syncing data in
  milliseconds across all connected clients. Data is stored as a single,
  hierarchical JSON tree and updated in real time—any changes made by one client
  are immediately pushed to every other. SDKs for iOS, Android and web handle
  offline caching and automatic resynchronization, while granular security rules
  and Firebase Authentication ensure data is accessed and modified only by
  authorized users. With built-in scalability, sharding and integration with
  other Firebase services (Cloud Functions, Analytics, etc.), the Realtime
  Database simplifies the creation of responsive, data-driven apps without the
  need to manage your own backend.
