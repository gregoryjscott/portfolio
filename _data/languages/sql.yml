title: SQL
desc: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in
  programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database
  management system (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks such as retrieving,
  updating, inserting, and deleting data from a database. SQL is also used to
  create and modify database structures, such as tables, views, and stored
  procedures. It is a powerful language that can be used to query, analyze, and
  manipulate data.
