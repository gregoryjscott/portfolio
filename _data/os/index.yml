    - title: Android
      desc: Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on a
        modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, and
        is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones
        and tablets. Android has a large community of developers writing
        applications ("apps") that extend the functionality of the devices. Apps
        can be downloaded from third-party app stores or through online stores
        such as Google Play. Android has been the best-selling OS on tablets
        since 2013, and on smartphones it is dominant by any metric.

    - title: macOS
      desc: macOS is Apple’s Unix‐based desktop operating system, first released in
        2001 as Mac OS X and built on the open‐source Darwin core and the
        proprietary XNU kernel. Designed exclusively for Mac computers, it
        combines a polished Aqua graphical interface with deep integration of
        hardware and software, offering features like Spotlight search, Time
        Machine backups, and Continuity for seamless work across Apple devices.
        With strong emphasis on stability, security and performance, macOS
        supports a rich ecosystem of native and third-party applications via the
        Mac App Store and developer tools such as Xcode, making it a popular
        choice for both creative professionals and everyday users.

        commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems and was the
        main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during
        the 1980s and the early 1990s. MS-DOS was designed to provide a
        user-friendly environment for running programs, managing files, and
        controlling peripheral devices such as printers and disk drives. It also
        provided a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
        MS-DOS was eventually replaced by Windows 95 and later versions of
        Windows.
