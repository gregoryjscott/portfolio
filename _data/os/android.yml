title: Android
desc: Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on a
  modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, and is
  designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and
  tablets. Android has a large community of developers writing applications
  ("apps") that extend the functionality of the devices. Apps can be downloaded
  from third-party app stores or through online stores such as Google Play.
  Android has been the best-selling OS on tablets since 2013, and on smartphones
  it is dominant by any metric.
