  In 2010, I was tasked with leading the replacement of the Quality Bank for the
  Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), the critical accounting system
  responsible for invoicing close to a billion dollars of crude oil each month.
  The system’s core challenge was its volatility. Due to constant litigation,
  the complex formulas for calculating oil quality were frequently changed
  retroactively, requiring months or even years of past invoices to be reissued
  with interest. The legacy system wasn’t designed for this reality; it was a
  brittle application riddled with one-off patches, requiring developer
  intervention for every court-ordered revision.


  Our solution was to re-architect the system around a new philosophy: business
  rules should be treated as versioned data, not as static code. We designed a
  sophisticated database-centric system where every variable affecting the
  calculations (from quality factors to pipeline configurations) could be
  versioned. This empowered the client’s team of accountants and lawyers to
  manage revisions independently by creating new versions of the underlying
  datasets, without writing a single line of code. To ensure the perfect
  accuracy required for a high-stakes financial system, the architecture was
  backed by a rigorous, test-driven development process.


  The result was a transformative success. The new Quality Bank became the
  single source of truth, giving the client the autonomy and confidence to
  manage their own revisions. As a final validation, we re-ran every invoice
  from the system's history, matching the legacy output to the penny.


  ## Key Takeaway


  A great team can build the impossible. For this project, that meant more than
  just technical skill; it was a combination of a disciplined, test-driven
  development process and a truly collaborative partnership with a client who
  was as committed to the outcome as we were.

      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.

      desc: Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings structure to
        client‐side applications by providing models with key–value binding and
        custom events, collections with rich enumerable functions, views with
        declarative event handling, and a router for managing application state
        and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync
        method, making it easy to fetch and persist JSON data. By relying only
        on Underscore.js (and optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes
        minimal constraints on how you architect your code while offering just
        enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications
        organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages decoupled
        components, and its simplicity has made it popular for developers who
        prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than adopt more
        opinionated frameworks.
