    - title: Ruby
      desc: Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by
        Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy to use,
        yet powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web development,
        scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of
        blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby
        is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the
        dynamic creation of code at runtime.
