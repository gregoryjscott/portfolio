      desc: Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by
        Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy to use,
        yet powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web development,
        scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of
        blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby
        is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the
        dynamic creation of code at runtime.

    - title: HAL
      subtitle: Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a a media type for
        representing resources with hyperlinks
      desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
        type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML,
        designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In
        HAL, each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its
        hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to
        navigate between related resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by
        an “_embedded” section. By providing a consistent convention for linking
        and embedding, HAL enables clients to follow HATEOAS
        principles—dynamically discovering available operations and
        transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.

    - title: Jekyll
      desc: Jekyll is an open-source, Ruby-based static site generator that transforms
        plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and
        Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using
        simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define metadata
        (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles content with shared
        layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it
        produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it
        delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub
        Pages) and maintain via version control.
