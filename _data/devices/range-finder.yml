title: Laser Range Finder
desc: A laser range finder is an optical device that measures distance by
  emitting a laser pulse toward a target and calculating range from the
  time-of-flight of the reflected signal. It delivers high-precision,
  non-contact measurement data used in surveying, robotics, industrial
  inspection and mapping. Its compact design and real-time output facilitate
  integration into automated systems requiring accurate spatial information.

      desc: Software that records output from a handheld laser range finder and
        combines it with records from a GPS unit which allows field workers to
        record the locations of objects that aren't assessible otherwise.
