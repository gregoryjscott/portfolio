title: FLIR Laser
desc: FLIR Laser is a laser rangefinding module integrated into FLIR thermal
  imaging devices that emits near-infrared pulses and measures their
  time-of-flight to calculate precise target distances. Itâ€™s commonly used in
  industrial inspection, surveying, search and rescue, and defense for accurate
  target acquisition and scene analysis under low-visibility conditions.
