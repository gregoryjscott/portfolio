        employed in mapping and turn-by-turn navigation, asset tracking, and
        location-based services, GPS delivers real-time positioning with
        meter-level accuracy across devices from smartphones to IoT sensors.

    - title: Laser Range Finder
      desc: A laser range finder is an optical device that measures distance by
        emitting a laser pulse toward a target and calculating range from the
        time-of-flight of the reflected signal. It delivers high-precision,
        non-contact measurement data used in surveying, robotics, industrial
        inspection and mapping. Its compact design and real-time output
        facilitate integration into automated systems requiring accurate spatial
        information.

        imaging devices that emits near-infrared pulses and measures their
        time-of-flight to calculate precise target distances. It’s commonly used
        in industrial inspection, surveying, search and rescue, and defense for
        accurate target acquisition and scene analysis under low-visibility
        conditions.
