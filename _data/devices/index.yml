    - title: Laser Range Finder
      desc: A laser range finder is an optical device that measures distance by
        emitting a laser pulse toward a target and calculating range from the
        time-of-flight of the reflected signal. It delivers high-precision,
        non-contact measurement data used in surveying, robotics, industrial
        inspection and mapping. Its compact design and real-time output
        facilitate integration into automated systems requiring accurate spatial
        information.
