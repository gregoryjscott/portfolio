              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

          - title: Expo
            desc: Expo is an open-source platform and toolchain built around React Native
              that lets developers write modern JavaScript or TypeScript to
              produce fully native iOS, Android and web apps without configuring
              Xcode or Android Studio. It provides a comprehensive SDK of
              prebuilt, cross-platform APIs (camera, sensors, notifications,
              maps, file system, etc.), a command-line interface for project
              scaffolding and local testing, and cloud services for building
              binaries, over-the-air updates, push-notification delivery and app
              store publishing. By abstracting away much of the native
              configuration—while still allowing “ejecting” to integrate custom
              native modules—Expo accelerates development, simplifies
              maintenance and lowers the barrier to entry for mobile-first
              teams.

              for containers that eliminates the need to provision, configure,
              and scale clusters of virtual machines. Fargate also provides a
              secure and reliable platform for running containers, allowing
              users to focus on building and running their applications, rather
              than managing the underlying infrastructure.

            subtitle: Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a a media type for
              representing resources with hyperlinks
            desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
              type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or
              XML, designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and
              self-descriptive. In HAL, each resource’s state is represented by
              its attributes, its hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section
              (allowing clients to navigate between related resources), and any
              embedded sub‐resources by an “_embedded” section. By providing a
              consistent convention for linking and embedding, HAL enables
              clients to follow HATEOAS principles—dynamically discovering
              available operations and transitions—without relying on
              out-of-band documentation.

              Developers push code to Heroku via Git or GitHub, and Heroku’s
              buildpacks automatically detect the language (such as Ruby,
              Node.js, Python, Java, Go or PHP), install dependencies and
              compile a runnable slug. Applications run in lightweight, isolated
              containers called dynos, which can be scaled horizontally or
              vertically on demand. The platform also offers a marketplace of
              add-ons (databases, caching, monitoring, logging, etc.), a
              web-based dashboard and a command-line interface, allowing teams
              to iterate quickly without managing underlying infrastructure.

              plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and
              Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using
              simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define
              metadata (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles
              content with shared layouts, includes and assets into fully
              rendered HTML files. Because it produces only static pages—no
              databases or server-side processing—it delivers fast, secure sites
              that are easy to host (notably on GitHub Pages) and maintain via
              version control.

          - title: React Native
            desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
              enables developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using
              JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native
              translates UI components into native platform widgets, delivering
              near-native performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based
              architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the web,
              making it easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like
              hot reloading accelerate the development cycle by instantly
              reflecting code changes on the device. A rich ecosystem of
              libraries and a large community contribute reusable modules and
              plugins, simplifying access to native device features (camera,
              geolocation, sensors) without writing platform-specific code. By
              sharing logic and UI components across platforms, React Native
              significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead
              compared to traditional native app development.

              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

            desc: Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings structure to
              client‐side applications by providing models with key–value
              binding and custom events, collections with rich enumerable
              functions, views with declarative event handling, and a router for
              managing application state and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with
              RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync method, making it easy to fetch
              and persist JSON data. By relying only on Underscore.js (and
              optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes minimal
              constraints on how you architect your code while offering just
              enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications
              organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages
              decoupled components, and its simplicity has made it popular for
              developers who prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than
              adopt more opinionated frameworks.
