    - title: CSS
      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.

        scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of
        blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby
        is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the
        dynamic creation of code at runtime.

      desc: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in
        programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database
        management system (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks such as
        retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting data from a database. SQL
        is also used to create and modify database structures, such as tables,
        views, and stored procedures. It is a powerful language that can be used
        to query, analyze, and manipulate data.

      desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
        type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML,
        designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In
        HAL, each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its
        hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to
        navigate between related resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by
        an “_embedded” section. By providing a consistent convention for linking
        and embedding, HAL enables clients to follow HATEOAS
        principles—dynamically discovering available operations and
        transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.

        Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using
        simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define metadata
        (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles content with shared
        layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it
        produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it
        delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub
        Pages) and maintain via version control.

    - title: React Native
      desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
        enables developers to build cross-platform apps using JavaScript and
        React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native translates UI
        components into native platform widgets, delivering near-native
        performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based architecture and
        one-way data flow mirror React for the web, making it easy for
        JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like hot reloading accelerate
        the development cycle by instantly reflecting code changes on the
        device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a large community contribute
        reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to native device
        features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing
        platform-specific code. By sharing logic and UI components across
        platforms, React Native significantly reduces development time and
        maintenance overhead compared to traditional native app development.
