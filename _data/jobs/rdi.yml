    - title: CSS
      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.

        custom events, collections with rich enumerable functions, views with
        declarative event handling, and a router for managing application state
        and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync
        method, making it easy to fetch and persist JSON data. By relying only
        on Underscore.js (and optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes
        minimal constraints on how you architect your code while offering just
        enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications
        organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages decoupled
        components, and its simplicity has made it popular for developers who
        prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than adopt more
        opinionated frameworks.

    - title: macOS
      desc: macOS is Apple’s Unix‐based desktop operating system, first released in
        2001 as Mac OS X and built on the open‐source Darwin core and the
        proprietary XNU kernel. Designed exclusively for Mac computers, it
        combines a polished Aqua graphical interface with deep integration of
        hardware and software, offering features like Spotlight search, Time
        Machine backups, and Continuity for seamless work across Apple devices.
        With strong emphasis on stability, security and performance, macOS
        supports a rich ecosystem of native and third-party applications via the
        Mac App Store and developer tools such as Xcode, making it a popular
        choice for both creative professionals and everyday users.
