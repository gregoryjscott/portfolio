subtitle: Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a a media type for
  representing resources with hyperlinks
desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
  type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML,
  designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In HAL,
  each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its hyperlinks by a
  standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to navigate between related
  resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by an “_embedded” section. By
  providing a consistent convention for linking and embedding, HAL enables
  clients to follow HATEOAS principles—dynamically discovering available
  operations and transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.
