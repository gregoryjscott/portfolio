title: SikuliX
desc: SikuliX is an open-source GUI automation tool that uses image recognition
  to interact with on-screen elements by matching screenshots. It lets you write
  scripts in Python (via Jython), Java, and other JVM languages to click, type,
  and verify UI states without needing native application hooks. Built on
  OpenCV, SikuliX works across Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it ideal for
  automating legacy or custom interfaces and integrating with testing frameworks
  for end-to-end automation or repetitive desktop task scripting.
