title: React Native
desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
  enables developers to build cross-platform apps using JavaScript and React.
  Instead of rendering web views, React Native translates UI components into
  native platform widgets, delivering near-native performance and look-and-feel.
  Its component-based architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the
  web, making it easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like hot
  reloading accelerate the development cycle by instantly reflecting code
  changes on the device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a large community
  contribute reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to native device
  features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing platform-specific
  code. By sharing logic and UI components across platforms, React Native
  significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead compared to
  traditional native app development.
