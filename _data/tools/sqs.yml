title: SQS
desc: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing
  service that enables applications to quickly and reliably queue messages that
  one component of an application can later process. SQS eliminates the
  complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
  message-oriented middleware, and provides a simple and cost-effective way to
  decouple the components of an application. SQS offers a reliable,
  highly-scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between
  computers. It also provides a simple web services interface that can be used
  to access queues, add, receive, and delete messages.
